# Restart Instance

When an instance encounters operational failures, excessive connection counts, or other unidentified issues during its runtime, you can resolve these problems by restarting the instance.

## Precautions

During the restart process, Pods will be restarted one by one, which may cause a brief interruption in services.

## Prerequisites

The instance must be in **Running** status.

**Note**:

- If the instance is in **Processing** status, this indicates that the instance is likely in the process of starting up normally. Please be patient.

- If the instance fails to start or experiences anomalies, resulting in it being in **Processing** or **Error** status, it will automatically restart after the health check times out. Please be patient.
