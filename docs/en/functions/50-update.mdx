# Update Specification

With the growth of data volume, timely scaling must be performed before resource usage approaches the storage quota to ensure continuous business availability.

## Restriction Description

1. If you have set scheduling-related configurations for the current instance, changes in the number of replicas must comply with the current scheduling configuration.

2. It is recommended to scale all nodes to the same specification in order to enhance the performance and reliability of the cluster.

3. When changing CPU and memory resources, please evaluate based on business conditions and resource availability to avoid instance scaling failures due to insufficient or excessive resources, which may lead to the instance not being able to start normally.
