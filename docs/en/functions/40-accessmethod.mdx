# Access Methods

Use producers and consumers to deliver messages to RabbitMQ from within or outside the cluster, or through a client.

## How to Obtain the Access Address

RabbitMQ instances support multiple access addresses to meet the needs of different scenarios.

### Access Within the Cluster

Access within the cluster is only available for internal access within the Kubernetes network. There are two options for connection addresses:

- Internal routing (i.e., via DNS)
- Internal routing IP

Both methods allow access to the RabbitMQ cluster.

Address retrieval path: Instance Details > Access Methods > Access Within the Cluster

### Access Outside the Cluster

Access outside the cluster can be used for external access to the Kubernetes network, such as accessing from another Kubernetes cluster (it can also be used for internal access within the Kubernetes cluster, but this needs to be confirmed against the firewall rules).

Currently, NodePort and LoadBalancer are the two supported methods for external access to the cluster.
