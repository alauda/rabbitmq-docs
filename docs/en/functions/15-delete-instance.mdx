# Delete Instance

Deleting an instance will not only remove the created CR resources but also delete the StatefulSet, Service, ConfigMap, Secret, PersistentVolumeClaim, and other resources created by RabbitMQ based on the CR resources.

## Steps to Operate

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="CLI">
    If the instance has not been configured for persistence, or if you need to retain the instance's persistent data, execute the following command to delete the instance:

    ```bash
    # delete rabbitmq instance directly
    kubectl -n default delete rabbitmqclusters <Instance Name>
    ```

    By default, deleting the instance will not remove the created PVC. You can use the following command to delete it:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n default delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/component=rabbitmq,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=rabbitmq,app.kubernetes.io/name=<Instance Name>
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="Web Console">
    1. In the left navigation bar, click **RabbitMQ**.

    2. Click on ***namespace name***.

    3. In the instance list, select the instance to be deleted, and enter the instance details page.

    4. In the upper right corner of the **Instance Details** page, click the **Actions** button to expand the function menu.

    5. Click **Delete** in the function menu, and a deletion confirmation dialog will pop up.

    6. For instances with data persistence enabled, you can check "Delete Persistent Volume Claim" to free up storage, or leave it unchecked to retain the data.

    7. In the pop-up dialog, enter the name of the instance to be deleted.

    8. Click **Delete**.
