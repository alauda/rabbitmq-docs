# Log Inquiry

Understand the instance's running process logs from the container level, such as RabbitMQ error logs. Proper use of logs can help you quickly locate problems and handle faults and exceptions.

**Note**: To save disk space, the platform retains log records for a default of 7 days (up to 30 days). The actual retention duration can be set in the operation and maintenance center under **Logs** > **Policy Management**. If long-term storage is required, please export the logs in a timely manner.

## Prerequisites

If the interface indicates no data, please deploy the **Log Collection Component** and ensure the component is running normally.
